	<p>Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist are locked in a dead heat race for governor in the final weeks of the campaign, and a new Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/UF Bob Graham Center poll shows Florida voters think very little of either candidate.</p>
	<p><span class="document-cloud-highlight not-open" onclick="docCloudDropdown('dch1','DC-note-182522',this);">The exclusive poll finds 40 percent of likely voters supporting Crist, 40 percent backing Scott, and 6 percent for Libertarian nominee Adrian Wyllie.</span></p>

	<p>Independent voters have broken toward Crist since a September poll from the Times' partners showed Scott leading by 5 percentage points and voters' already negative impressions of the governor have grown even worse.</p>
	<p>"I don't like either candidate," said George Welch, a 50-year-old Republican in Dade City, who wishes he had a different Republican choice. "I'm going to vote for Scott because I won't vote for Charlie. &hellip; Part of the reason is that he changes parties and partly that he supports Obama."</p>
